# Synchronization using Mutual Exclusion and Condition Variables
A project using pthread library in C language to synchronize the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen atoms to make water molecules using mutual exclusion and condition variables.

- You can use the included Makefile to compile your code and run the test cases.

- You will need to type the command 'make' to build the code.
```
[uname@hostname ~]$ make
```

- You will need to type the command 'make run' to run the test cases.
```
[uname@hostname ~]$ make run
```

- You may use ./reaction x to test the program for the percentage of hydrogen set to x%.
```
[uname@hostname ~]$ ./reaction x
```
